# Ease of retrieval as information
Two groups of participants were asked to recall either 6 or 12 episodes in which they were assertive. The group which was asked to retrieve 6 episodes was on average more confident in their assertiveness.

## Abstract

title: Abstract

Experienced ease of recall was found to qualify the implications of recalled content. Ss who had to recall 12 examples of assertive (unassertive) behaviors, which was difficult, rated themselves as less assertive (less unassertive) than Ss who had to recall 6 examples, which was easy. **In fact, Ss reported higher assertiveness after recalling 12 unassertive rather than 12 assertive behaviors.** Thus, self-assessments only reflected the implications of recalled content if recall was easy. The impact of ease of recall was eliminated when its informational value was discredited by a misattribution manipulation. The informative functions of subjective experiences are discussed.
