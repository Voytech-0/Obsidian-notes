# Forgetting
**Forgetting curve** - The amount of forgotten information can be described in Terms of exponential decay. We forget the most at the beginning but then we forget less.
The probability of forgetting depends on:
- Probability of an event
- You hear more details on the episode
- When repeated more often
- Longer time between event and recall
- Under social pressure 


**Retention interval** - The amount of time that enables between the initial learning and the subsequent retrieval. 

**Decay theory of forgetting** - a theory proposing that we forget as our cells die off. 

**Interference theory of forgetting** - New learning can disrupt the older memories.
- It seems to be supported by a study on Football players. Players remembered who they played with based on the number of matches they played, not the time passed since then

**Retrieval failure** - Forgotten memory is still in the [[Long term memory]] but we cannot retrieve it. Memory cannot be allocated. 
When we are happy we are more likely to remember happy memories and otherwise. 

All three theories are probably involved in some degree
