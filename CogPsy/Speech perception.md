# Speech perception

- Normal speech contains about 180 words / minute
- Speech segmentation is not so easy. [[Coarticulation]] makes it even more difficult. 
- Speech perception reliefs not only on the stimuli themselves. 
	- It uses prior knowledge about words to fill in missing information. 
	- Supplements input with knowledge on the context in which they appear.
	- Speech recognition is sometime difficult without a context.

**Phonemic restoration effect**:
Our brain automatically fills our gaps in read and spoken words. 

Speech perception but a serial, continuous process of matching studious with vocabulary. 

Looking at faces help understand speech. 

[[The McGurk effect]] - The mouth movement influences what we hear. Ex. ‘Ba’ and ‘Fa’ depending on the image of the person producing the sound. Vision can dominate auditory perception. 

**Categorical perception** - We are better at distinguishing *between* categories than *within* them.
- \[g] and \[k] are easily distinguishable. Yet, they depend on VOC - Voice-onset time. 
- We are insensitive to sub-phonemic variations. It allows robustness in understanding language. Eg. The variations between speakers doesn’t affect our understanding much. 

Some sequences are acceptable in a language.
- \[tl] is not acceptable in English. Neither is \[rz] although it is acceptable in Polish.
