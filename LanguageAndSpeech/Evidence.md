# Rational handling of evidence
AI methods are studies for preventing mistakes
# Argumentative analysis of evidence
- Wigmore chart - argumentative connection for legal cases

# Scenario analysis of evidence
- Proof in a criminal trial is essentially telling a good story
	1. story quality:
		- Has **central action**
		- has no **loose ends**
		- is **unambiguous** in explaining the central action
		- has **no contradictions**
	1. Story anchoring
		- Evidence is accepted or rejected as proof on the basis of *anchors*, i.e. common-sense generally true rules
		- Anchoring rules can have exceptions 
		- Stories are hierarchically nested

# Hybrid argumentative-narrative diagrams
There are **evidential rules** and **causal rules**
**Evidential rules**:
- Connect the evidence to elements of a story
**Causal rules**:
- Connect elements in a story

## Local and global coherence
- **local coherence** is determined by the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">causal rules</mark> connecting its events
- **global coherence** is determined by the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">story schemes</mark> it matches

# Probabilistic analysis of evidence
Some type of evidence such as DNA can give a probability given by **profile frequency** 

# Three normative frameworks
We should work with:
- arguments - E.g., take all arguments into account, both pro and con, assess strength and relative strength, avoid fallacies
- scenarios - E.g., consider alternative scenarios, assess plausibility and coherence, consider which evidence is explained or contradicted
- probabilities - E.g., follow the calculus, don’t transpose conditional probabilities, don’t forget prior probabilities
