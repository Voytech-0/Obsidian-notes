# Autobiographical memory
The self-reference effect
- Better memory for information about oneself.

The self-schema
- A set of beliefs and memories about oneself. Ex. When one is depressed, it is easier for them to recall depressing thoughts. 

Memories of our life is a mic of real memories and reconstructions based on [[Schema]]ta

Consistency bias:
- People exaggerating the consistency of their own feelings, beliefs and behaviours

Our autobiographical memories are biased to emphasise consistency and positive traits. 

It all makes the past look more like the present

Emotional events are remembered better. 
- They trigger a response in the [[amygdala]] that promotes consolidation.
- They narrow down the attention 
- We rehearse these memories more

The emotional response can create [[Flashbulb memory]] - one which is vividly remembered.
