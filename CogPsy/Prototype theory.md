# Prototype theory

- The more similar to something looks to a certain “idea”, the larger the probability that it is a part of that category
- Each member of that category can gave more or less of these properties 
- Category is not defined by a boundary, but by a central member - a **prototype**

**Prototype** - The central member, by which the category is defined

- Some members of a category are **better** members than others
- An apple is *fruitier* than a watermelon 

**Typicality effect**:
- The further away from the centre, the more difficult categorisation becomes
	- Production: more typical examples are named first 
	- Sentence and picture verification is faster
- The ordinary member of a category is usually found attractive. It is a great news for ordinarily looking people 

[[Typicality vs Attractiveness]]

**Base level categorisation**:
- The basic level of categorisation is neither too general nor too specific.
	- A chair is a “chair” as opposed to ‘furniture’ or a ‘wooden desk chair’
- It is usually a single word 
- These are first learned by children 
- There seems to appear a natural level of categorisation
