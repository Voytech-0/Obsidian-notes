# Representativeness heuristics

The more representative something, the more probable it seems.

Think about the *Linda problem* and *Gambler’s fallacy*. 

**Gambler’s fallacy**: A coin does not remember its previous results. A series of ‘tails’ doe not increase the probability of getting a ‘head’. 
	There is no tendency for small samples tho represent the general population


The basic error is:
- Assuming a category is homogenous 

**Hamil et al. 1980:**
- Experiment with two ‘prison guards’. One is compassionate, the other is hard and contemptuous
- Groups of people were told that the guards are or are not representative.
- The information about representativeness did not changed het results of the experiment. 

**The “Man who… “ argument**:
- Decision based on one example
	- Anecdotal evidence, or ‘man who’ stories
- Do we trust statistics or anecdotal evidence rather than statistical data.
