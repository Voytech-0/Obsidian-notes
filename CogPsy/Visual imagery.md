# Visual imagery

Kosslyn (1976):
- Thinking about an object and imagining it have different effects.
- Visual knowledge and conceptual knowledge must be therefore separate. 

Francis Galton (1883):
- Introspection to study mental imagery (self-reports)
- Participants’ self reports suffered that they could inspect their images just like a picture
- Second point

Image-scanning procedure:
- People were asked to ‘go’ from one place on a map to the other.
- The further away on the map, the longer it take to mentally go form one place to the other
- Mental images seem to preserve the spatial layout of original picture

Our brain seems to preserve the scale and details. We have to mentally zoom in to see some details. 

**Mental-rotation task** - The response time should be higher for large angles. 
- Plane rotations or rotation in depth lead to similar results 
- These results are observed even when the participants are not asked to visualise the object. 

- **Occipital areas** used for early. Visual processing are active during imaginer
- More brain tissue is activated when participants imagine larger objects or more details
- Face and motion regions are active while people imagine faces and motion
- Visualised images can be decoded based on brain activity from …

[[Neglect syndrome]]:
- People with neglect syndrome imagine only half of the world 

**Visual imagery and spatial imagery**:
- Blind people take the same time with mental-rotation or image-scanning tasks
	- Response time is proportional to the distance traveled
- Patients may show disrupts in visual processing and imagery but not in spatial processing and imagery (or the other way around)

**Individual differences**:
- People differ in the ability to visually imagine
- This is a spectrum
- On one end is [[Aphantasia]], on the other [[Eidetic memory]] (or photographic)

Mental images are not pictures
- Perception is not neutral
- Perception goes beyond the information given
- Picture may be ambiguous but our perception is one interpretation
- Mental images correspond to one interpretation. Ex. *Necker cube*
