# Intrusion errors
Errors which results in additional information being associated with an episode in memory. 

We are likely to add information to received memory based on connections associated with a concept and additional context available to us.

An example of that is a [[DRM procedure]] - in which participants were given a list of words associated with sleeping, such as: “bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, snooze, wake etc”. Participants are extremely likely to recall ‘sleep’ as one of the words, although the word in not included in the list. Moreover, they are very confident in the occurrence of this word. 

One iconic example is with the text of Nancy and a professor at a cocktail party.

People spent 35 seconds in a room of a professor. After leaving the room, they were asked to recall the things present in the room. Many people recalled seeing books, as books are closely associated with academic offices. This is schematic knowledge. [[Schema]]
