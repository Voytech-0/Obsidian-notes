# Selective attention
```ad-quote
title: William James

Everyone know what attention is. 

```

**Shadowing** - A task of repeating what one is hearing. A kind of echoing
**Dichotic listening** - Listening to two different tracks with both ears. Only one track can be attended at a time. Therefore the channels are then divided into **attended** and **unattended**. 
**Cocktail party effect** - We listen to one conversation while the other is tuned out. Yet, we are able to hear our name being said.
**Inhabiting distractors** - one of the theories on Selective attention says that the unattended input is somehow blocked, or filtered out.
**Inattentional blindness** - A pattern in which people fail to see a prominent stimulus even though they’re staring straight at it.
