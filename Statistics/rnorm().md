# rnorm(n, mean, sd)
This function is used to generate random numbers whose distribution is normal. It takes the sample size as input and generates that many random numbers. We draw a histogram to show the distribution of the generated numbers.

***rnorm(n)*** is a random sample of size $n$ for mean $= 0$ and $sd = 1$
