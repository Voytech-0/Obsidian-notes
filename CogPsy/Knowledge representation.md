# Knowledge representation
**Knowledge network**:
- Knowledge is represented via a vast network of connections and associations between all of the information you know.
- The length of connections between nodes is represented by the time needed to check truth of a sentence; ’canary is a canary‘  is easier and blaster than ‘a canary is an animal’
- *Properties* take longer time than *categories*
- Nodes can represent concepts
