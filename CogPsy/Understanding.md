# Understanding
Nodes in memory are remembered in relation to other nodes. They create a network of memories. Each event must be analysed and understood to be saved in our memory. The connections create [[Retrieval paths]] which then help in recall.

Understanding can also hurt memories, as the boundaries between event become blurry. It is hard to distinguish when one episode starts and another ends.

These connections can cause [[Intrusion errors]].
