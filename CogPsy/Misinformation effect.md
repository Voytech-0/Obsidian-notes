# Misinformation effect
Misinformation effect is a term referring to memory errors that result from misinformation  received after an event was experienced. 

The effect can be achieved in number of ways:
- “what was the speed of the car when it scratched / hit / collided with the other car?”
		-  The memories are **regularised** to match the speed associated with a given verb
		- When asked about that later on, the participants who were asked about the ‘smashed’ cars could remember non-existent details such as broken glass.
- “Was the man bleeding from his knee or elbow?” Implied that t he man had to be bleeding
- “Read the eyewitness testimony and match the recall”

It is **easier to plant** a false memory when the information supplements, not contradicts what one’s remembering.

These errors can be encouraged by:
- **Repeatedly asking a question** about a false event / information
- Creating false ‘evidence’
- Be encouraging confession and recall of inexistent memories, one researcher managed to convince students that they assaulted another person with a weapon a few years prior to the experiment.


**Destructive update** 
- New information of an event overwrites the earlier memory
- This can also happen in hypnotherapy
- It makes people more susceptible to suggestion and more vulnerable to the misinformation effect
