# Sound perception
Same week as [[Fourier transform]]

### Sound localisation 
	We can approximate the direction of the sound's source by:
- Phase difference in heard sound
	- Works best for short sounds and low frequency sounds
- Intensity difference between sounds
	- One ear may be in an *acoustic shadow*
	- Applies to high frequencies

## 1. outer ear (auricle and ear canal)
	Funnel acoustic waves into the ear canal
- **Auricle (pinna)**
	- Important for directional hearing
	- Discerns horizontally and vertically incoming signals
- **Ear canal**
	- It is ±2.5 cm long
	- It can produce harmonics (resonance frequency) for certain frequencies depending on the length of the ear canal. 
	- There are only odd harmonics, as the canal is closed at one end
	- Filters sound that comes through.

Sound localisation:
- measuring a phase shift, we can determine the direction of source of sound
	- Works for short or low frequency sounds
- There is also a difference in amplitude 
	- Works best for high frequencies 

## 2. Middle ear
- *Hammer*, anvil *and* *stirrup* part
- It is filled with fluid, so the frequency changes 
- Tympanic membrane (eardrum) vibrated with air
- Hammer, anvil and stirrup transfer vibrations
- *Stirrup* transfers vibrations to the *oval window*.
	- Oval window is 1/20 the size of the *ear drum*
- **Stapedius** is a tiny muscle between the stapes and the wall of the middle ear cavity. When contracted it dampens the vibrations transmitted to inner ear.
	- It can partially dampen loud sounds. Doesn't work for sudden sounds (explosions)

## 3. Inner ear
Also known as **cochlea**
- The part that actually translates vibrations into signals
- *Basilar membrane* (BM) contains receptors. It is considered a filter bank with bandpass filters. 
	- It is a stiff structure within cochlea that separates two liquid-filled tubes
- We are less sensitive to higher frequencies – they are harder to distinguish
	- ![[Pasted image 20221028174937.png|400]]


We can translate spectrogram into **cochleogram** to show how the sound is perceived by our ears. 
- Its notable feature is worsened detection at low amplitudes
